  sceneDescription: "Oh ok, what about this, last week you needed to deal with the
    insane increase of taxes that was established by the new monarchy, Casandra is
    very worried that, your new child will not have the opportunity to get a good
    education, because now everything is more expensive. You wonder if not saving
    the princess was a mistake, maybe if you had saved her, the kingdom would had
    not fallen in to chaos, and things would be better. Then you've got to deal with
    the delay in shipping for next month, don\u2019t get me started sbut that. They
    keep delaying your request and you started to suspect that maybe they are lying
    to you, and all of this is actually a scam. You are unsure how to break the news
    to Casandra, she has been so stressed these couple of days, you think that the
    poor Foolee will not be able to take much more of it. \nSo is THIS ENOUGH adventure
    for you? Does this satisfy your desire for \"Adventure\"??"
