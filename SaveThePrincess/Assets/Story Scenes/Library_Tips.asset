  sceneDescription: "-Some actions will only be available if the player meets certain
    requirements or triggers some events\n\n-If something is in BLOCK CAPITALS\u2026it
    is probably something important or something that would be good to research in
    the library\n\n-Remember, it is really hard to die in this game, BUT there are
    a few times where the player can truly die\u2026so don\u2019t be afraid to experiment
    around in each play through!\n\n-There is something called a \u201CPerk\u201D.
    They are obtained after the player manages to do something special. There are
    three in total. Ones a perk is obtained, the player will keep it for every future
    playthrough."
