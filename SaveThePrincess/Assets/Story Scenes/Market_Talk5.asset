  sceneTitle: 'Epilogue '
  sceneDescription: "Oh, so you are curious what happens next? Well I mean, the princess
    is 100% DEAD, that is for sure, but that is not important to you right? Now you
    have a family to take care of. The other day I saw you talking to another Griffolk
    about getting a love voucher, Casandra has been hinting about wanting to have
    a kid. Sure the kingdom was in chaos for a while, there was some assassination,
    the royals were fighting for the throne, and all that jazz, but you are a simple
    Bavom running a general store, with your partner Casandra, a common Foolee with
    nothing remarkable in her life. Yeah, you are a normal and simple citizen that
    pay your taxes and do what you need to do, nothing more, and nothing less. And
    I mean, THIS is basically a big adventure don\u2019t you think? You got to date
    a cute little Foolee, then you became partners, you started a family. That is
    the adventure of life\u2026\n...oh I see, so you are not satisfied? "
