  sceneDescription: 'No really, did you hack a demo showcase? There''s no way to
    get that much money without hacking the game.


    Ok then I guess... now that
    outside exists all the people outside exist too. That includes the FBI, so since
    you''re so rich I hope you enjoy doing your taxes.'
